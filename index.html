        <h2>Cutting-edge speakers <br>for over 75 years</h2>
        <p>
            Since 1936, San Joaqin Valley Town Hall has showcased nationally and internationally renowned,
            thought-provoking, speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience.

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
            1937: In the town of Hanford, California, Clio Lee Aydelott—a woman of letters—hoped to
            make an addition to the Central Valley's intellectual and cultural life by providing a
            venue for "thinking adults to become better informed." A Town Hall series, already established
            in twenty other U.S. cities, thus debuted in Fresno with a program in 1938; it consisted of
            seven morning and six evening lectures. The lectures were so well received that a second series
            was scheduled for the fall of the same year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lecture series continued under the direction of Dr. Rappaport for eight seasons. At that
            time, the San Joaquin Valley Town Hall of Fresno was formed to produce the lecture series
            independently. The first series of six morning lectures began in October of 1946, and that
            format continues to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, Town Hall has hosted almost 500 speakers who have provided stimulating, intellectual
            entertainment. Some speakers of note include Margaret Mead, Bennett Cerf, Agnes DeMille,
            James Michener, Gore Vidal, Maya Angelou, Ray Bradbury, Condoleezza Rice, Henry Kissinger,
            and Chet Huntley. In the future, Town Hall will continue to work hard to bring you speakers who
            will enlighten and entertain.

            Author of the critically acclaimed best seller, <em>The Nine: Inside the Secret World
            of the Supreme Court</em>, Jeffrey Toobin brings the inside story of one of America's
            most mysterious and powerful institutions to the Saroyan stage. At the podium,
            Toobin is an unbiased, deeply analytic expert on American law, politics and procedure
            and he provides a unique look into the inner workings of the Supreme Court

        <p>
            What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage
            Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson,
            Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's
            research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has
            conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from
            the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or
            horned dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the
            growth and function of certopsid horns and frills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American
            Museum of Natual History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of
            anatomy at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the
            University of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of
            Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural
            History. His research interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional
            morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological
            work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was
            also the on-the-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a
            book, <em>Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life</em>, which is one of the most
            comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
